    "* Parameters are the \"settings\" for a given model - for a linear model in the form y = mx + c, the parameters are m and c\n",
    "* Maximum Likelihood Estimation returns the values for the parameters of a model that maximize the chance that the observations were created by that model\n",
    "* When calculating maximum likelihood we often use a log likelihood to simplify calculations (allowing us to decompose products into simpler sums)\n",
    "* It's important to consider algorithmic bias when building models as biased observations will tend to generate a biased model (if banks are less likely to provide loans to African Americans, a model trained on such data is likely to perpetuate that bias)\n",
    "* Gradient descent is a method for traversing a cost curve to find a local minima or maxima (or saddle point)\n",
    "* A sigmoid function can be used to map a linear regression model to a range from 0 to 1, allowing for a logistic regression which can be used as a binary classifier\n",
    "* A regularization parameter can be used to apply a cost to overfitting, reducing the likelihood of overfitting your model\n"
